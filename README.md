This site will include status updates for if the Mastodon instance is down for everyone and why.


2020-01-06 06:12 UTC: I guess e wstart off the New Year with outgrowing our server. Everything is running so high that I don't think it an handle our community at the moment. Currently it is up but not operational. I will try to patch it up temporarily, but we may have to wait for a more permanent solution. I would have to resetup the whole Mastodon instance and copy our data, which could take some time.
